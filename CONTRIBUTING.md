# Contributing to cb-env

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in cb. This repository holds the `cb` command-line tool, the local agent and the preload (`@cb/env`).
cb is split across three repositories — [cb-env](https://github.com/gdhyani/cb-env),
[cb-backend](https://github.com/gdhyani/cb-backend) and [cb-dashboard](https://github.com/gdhyani/cb-dashboard) —
and they share one contribution process.

The full contributor guide lives in the Community section of the docs (`/docs/community` in the dashboard, or `content/docs/community/` in [gdhyani/cb-dashboard](https://github.com/gdhyani/cb-dashboard/tree/main/content/docs/community)): local development across all three repositories,
code standards, adding a connector and updating the docs.

## Ways to contribute

- **Report a bug** with the bug report form in Issues.
- **Ask for a feature** or **a new connector** (a service cb should broker) with the matching issue form.
- **Improve the docs**: fix a mistake, clarify a step, add an example.
- **Fix an issue**: look for issues labelled `good first issue` or `help wanted`, and comment that you are
  taking one before you start.
- **Review pull requests** and try changes locally.

Security vulnerabilities are never reported in public issues. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Development setup

You need Node.js 22 or newer and npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gdhyani/cb-env.git
cd cb-env
npm install
npm run build
node dist/cli/index.js status     # checks the backend at http://localhost:4200 (override with --server or CB_SERVER_URL)
```

Most commands need a running backend. See the Local development page in the docs to start
[cb-backend](https://github.com/gdhyani/cb-backend) next to this repository.

## Branches and commits

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main` named `<type>/<short-slug>`,
   for example `feat/redis-tls` or `fix/login-redirect`.
2. Write commits in [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) form:
   `type(scope): summary`, where type is one of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci` or `chore`.
   Keep the summary short and say what changes for the user.
3. Open a pull request against `main` and fill in the template. Keep each pull request to one change.

## Tests

```bash
npm test                # builds first, then runs Vitest (CLI tests run the compiled bin)
npm run lint            # Biome
npm run typecheck       # TypeScript
```

Changes to the agent, the preload or `cb run` should also pass the end-to-end suite
(`npm run test:e2e`). It needs the test services from `cb-backend/docker-compose.test.yml`;
the README explains how to start them.

Before you ask for review:

- Write the test first, then the code. Every new behaviour has at least one test.
- `npm test`, `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` pass locally and in CI.

## Docs

Every user-visible change — a page, a flow, a label, a command, a flag, a connector, configuration or an
error message — updates the documentation in
[`cb-dashboard/content/docs/`](https://github.com/gdhyani/cb-dashboard/tree/main/content/docs) in the same change.
For a change in this repository that means a companion pull request in cb-dashboard, linked from yours.
If nothing a user or contributor sees has changed, write `Docs: not needed — <reason>` in the pull request.

## Never commit secrets

Never commit real secrets, tokens, private keys, `.env` files or personal data — not in code, tests,
fixtures, screenshots or logs. Use stand-in values that contain a `cb` marker, such as `sk_test_cb…`,
`sk-cb-…` or `cbu_ab12cd34`, and addresses on an `.example` domain for any email or host.
Never log a secret or a token; use the repository's redaction helper.
